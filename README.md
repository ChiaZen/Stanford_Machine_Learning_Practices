## The full machine learning specialisation course contained:
1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
1. Advanced Learning Algorithms
1. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

* Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn libraries, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression).
* Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods.
* Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection.
* Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model.

Deep-dive into each topic, I've learnt:

### Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
* Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & scikit-learn.
* Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression.

### Advanced Learning Algorithms
* Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
* Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
* Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.

### Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
* Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
* Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep-learning method.
* Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
